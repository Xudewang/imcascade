``imcascade`` is a non-parametric framework for fitting objects in astronomical images using a "cascade" of Gaussians. It was designed to study the morphology of faint, semi-resolved galaxies. If you are in using ``imcascade`` we suggest reading our paper describing the method here (Link to come soon) and the documentation `here <https://imcascade.readthedocs.io>`_.
